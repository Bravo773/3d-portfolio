        I have around five years of experience working at multiple warehouse jobs, where I learned how to assemble and work on various machines and work as a team. I also learned how to manage a returns department and have good customer service. I am excited and highly motivated to start a new IT career. I have always had an interest in IT. I enjoy building computers, and when problems come up, I like resolving them, especially if it's a challenge. I am a recent graduate of an intensive five course IT program where I obtained the Google IT Support Professional Certificate. And developed skills in customer service, networking, operating systems, system administration, and security with hands-on practice in these areas. I look forward to starting a new career in IT and learning more about the IT field.
